## How Does Smodin Work
You add a social profile (facebook, linkedin, twitter), choose an industry (i.e. medical), answer questions about your business, called "Parameters", and Smodin provides auto populated posts for you ready to use and ready to schedule. To reuse these posts, use the rewriter which quickly rewrites the post for later use in the future. Set up the weekly or monthly schedule (or choose the randomized schedule), and never touch your social media again.

Main Benefit: Create one year worth of ready to use social posts scheduled within one hour of sign up.

## Feature List
- Choose from multiple Industries with pre-populated Social Posts and relevant Parameters
- Add your own Social Posts and Parameters
- User Interface designed to easily identify parameters, responses, and versatility
- Choose your scheduling on a per month/week basis or choose a ready-made schedule
- Add images to posts
- Search for your posts with ease
- Easy to reference/find Social Post ideas, Social Post Examples, and Parameters
