# Is something NOT worth testing?
1. will test duplicate exactly the application code?
2. will making assertions in test duplicate a behavior that is already covered by (and responsiblity of) library code?
3. is this detail important to outsider perspective, or only internal concern? If so, can internal detail be described only with a public API?

# Things to test
- div always rendered
- div contains everything else that gets rendered in side
- what should and shouldn't be rendered
